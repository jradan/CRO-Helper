# 📘 CRO Test Brief: Domain Order Form Update v2

## ✅ Summary
We propose testing an updated domain order form layout to improve domain selection clarity and increase conversions. The current layout overwhelms users and lacks visual hierarchy.

## 🎯 Hypothesis
If we redesign the domain order form layout to better differentiate options visually, then users will more easily complete their domain orders, because the current structure lacks hierarchy and overwhelms users.

## 🧪 Variants
- **Control**: Current domain order form
- **Variant A**: Updated domain order form with improved flow and visual hierarchy

| Clarity & User Trust   | 5           | Enhances decision clarity with no manipulation |
| **Total**              | 15          |           |

## 🎯 Goals
