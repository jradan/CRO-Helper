# 📘 CRO Test Brief: Plan Layout Redesign

## ✅ Summary
We propose testing a redesigned pricing plan layout to improve plan selection clarity and increase conversions. The current layout overwhelms users and lacks visual hierarchy.

## 🎯 Hypothesis
If we redesign the pricing plan layout to simplify decision-making and visually differentiate plans, then users will convert at higher rates, because the current flat design causes indecision.

## 🧪 Variants
- **Control**: Flat 4-column layout
- **Variant A**: Staggered pricing ladder layout
- **Variant B**: Simplified bullets with persona labels

## 🧠 Pre-Test Scoring

| Impact                 | 5           | Key monetization point |
| Confidence             | 3           | Good rationale, modest prior evidence |
| Effort                 | 2           | Layout and copy changes only |
| Clarity & User Trust   | 5           | Reduces cognitive load |
| **Total**              | 15          |           |

## 🎯 Goals
