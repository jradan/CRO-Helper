## 🎯 Hypothesis & Goals

**Hypothesis**
If we redesign the pricing plan layout to better differentiate plans visually, then users will more easily choose the right plan, because the current structure lacks hierarchy and overwhelms users.

**Primary Goal**
Increase mid-tier or paid plan selection

**Secondary Goal**
Reduce plan compare clicks, increase clarity engagement
