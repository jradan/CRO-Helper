# 🧪 Experiment Title
Redesign Pricing Plan Layout to Improve Plan Selection Clarity

## 🎯 Hypothesis & Goals

**Hypothesis**
If we redesign the pricing plan layout to better differentiate plans visually, then users will more easily choose the right plan, because the current structure lacks hierarchy and overwhelms users.

**Primary Goal**
Increase mid-tier or paid plan selection

Reduce plan compare clicks, increase clarity engagement

---

## 📍 Context

- **Page**: WordPress Hosting Pricing Page
- **Device**: Desktop
- **Traffic Volume**: High

---

## 🛠️ Test Variations

- **Control**: Flat 4-column layout, dense feature bullets
- **Variant A**: Ladder-style visual hierarchy with color emphasis
- **Variant B**: Simplified bullets + “Best for…” persona tags
